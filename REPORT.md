### Previous Experience
I have been working as a software developer for the past 4 years, both part and full-time. While most of my web development experience comes from personal projects in high school, I was able to get through simple layouts to make this website without many issues. As a refresher, I looked through https://www.w3schools.com/.

### Inspiration
- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryw3css_templates_portfolio.htm
    - Projects displayed first.
    - Washed out colourscheme (monochrome with blue accent) is very easy on the eyes.

    - Dislike how messy the site feels. 
    - 3 different fonts and multiple clashing colours are very abrasive to my eyes.

    - Smooth animations when hovering over projects.
    - Not responsive to smaller screen sizes.

### Design Choices

For colour, I decided to keep it clean and simple. I am using the default light theme colour palette from Bootstrap. The only modification I made was changing the text colour of the `a` tag to a lime green, which is my favourite colour.

Regarding fonts, I chose "Ubuntu", by Google Fonts. Not only is the font very readable, which is my first priority as someone who can struggle to read certain fonts, but it is also the font used by the Linux distro, which is sort of a homage to my interests in Linux. I am only using one font (with a bold weight for headings) to reduce visual clutter.

When designing the layout of the website, I looked to the w3schools portfolio for inspiration. For the scaling of the website elements, I make use of Bootstrap's responsive and dynamic elements to make sure some elements aren't too large or small. Since I do not have any current UI experience or projects, I have placed the placeholders at the bottom, showing the importance on my personal information and other experience. I have aimed to make the website symmetrical down the y-axis, and where I couldn't, I attempted to counter-balance elements with eachother. The links I have placed throughout the page are contrasting the white background and black text with a nice lime green that pops out to the user, inviting them to visit the other pages.s
